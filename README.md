# LastLift
LastLift is a native iOS workout tracking app built with SwiftUI and SwiftData. It runs entirely on-device with no server or account required.

## Background
I have chronic pain that's best managed by consistently doing a decently wide range of exercises and stretches. However, my schedule is busy and my body isn't always feeling up for certain exercises, so it's hard for me to have a recurring workout schedule.

I used to sometimes forget about certain exercises for a while and then my pain would flare up again, so I built LastLift to give me a view that no other workout tracking app did: within a given group (back, knee, stretches), *which exercises have the **longest gap** since I last performed them?*
